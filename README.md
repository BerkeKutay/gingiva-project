# Gingiva Periodontal Detection System

A deep learning–based system for detecting periodontal conditions from intraoral images.  
The project focuses on medical image analysis, model training, and scalable deployment practices.

## Problem Statement

Periodontal diseases are among the most common oral health problems worldwide. 
Early detection is critical for preventing severe complications. 

This project aims to develop a computer vision model capable of detecting gingival and periodontal conditions from intraoral images using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the following publicly available dataset:

Mendeley Data:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3253gj88rr/1

The dataset consists of annotated intraoral images for periodontal analysis.

## Model Architecture

- Model: YOLO-based object detection
- Framework: PyTorch
- Task: Periodontal region detection
- Training environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Model Performance

- Accuracy: 91%
- Precision: 89%
- Recall: 87%
- mAP: 0.85

## Model Weights

The trained model weights are hosted on Hugging Face:

The model is automatically downloaded when running the application.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BerkeKutay/gingiva-project.git
cd gingiva-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Future Improvements
